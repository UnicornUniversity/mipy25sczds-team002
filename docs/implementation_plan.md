# Deadlock - Implementation Plan

This document serves as a bridge between the game design document and task distribution, providing concrete steps for implementing Deadlock using the existing codebase as a foundation.

> **Note:** This document has been updated to reflect a more realistic scope for a 3-person team with a 2-day development timeline. Features marked with "(Optional)" are lower priority and should only be implemented if time permits.

## Current Codebase Analysis

The existing codebase provides a solid foundation with:
- Basic game loop and state management
- Simple player movement
- Menu and gameplay states
- Settings management

## Implementation Strategy

### Day 1: Essential Systems

1. **Enhance GameState System**
   - Add GameOverState
   - Extend GameplayState to handle zombie spawning and game mechanics
   - Add PauseState (Optional)
   - Add HighScoreState (Optional)

2. **Expand Constants and Settings**
   - Add constants for basic zombie type, weapons, and game mechanics
   - Extend Settings class to include basic game options

3. **Create Entity System**
   - Implement base Entity class
   - Create Player class extending Entity
   - Implement basic Zombie class extending Entity
   - Add Item and Pickup classes for health and ammo

4. **Map Generation System**
   - Create simple MapGenerator class
   - Implement tile-based map system
   - Add basic obstacle generation
   - Add building generation (Optional)

5. **Collision System**
   - Implement simple collision detection
   - Handle entity-entity collisions
   - Handle entity-environment collisions

### Day 2: Gameplay and Polish

1. **Weapon System**
   - Create Weapon base class
   - Implement pistol as primary weapon
   - Add ammo and reload mechanics
   - Implement additional weapon types (Optional)

2. **UI System**
   - Create HUD elements (health bar, ammo counter, score)
   - Implement main menu and game over screens
   - Add basic visual feedback elements

3. **Pathfinding System**
   - Implement simple pathfinding for zombies
   - Handle basic obstacle avoidance
   - Implement A* algorithm (Optional)

4. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - Implement time-based zombie spawn rate increase
   - Balance zombie spawning

5. **Audio System**
   - Add basic sound effects for weapons and zombies
   - Implement simple background music
   - Add dynamic music system (Optional)

```

## Integration Points

To ensure smooth integration between team members' work, the following integration points should be established:

1. **Entity-Map Integration**
   - Entities need to interact with the map for collision and pathfinding
   - Team Members 1 and 2 should coordinate on this interface

2. **Weapon-Entity Integration**
   - Weapons need to affect entities (damage, knockback)
   - Team Members 1 and 3 should coordinate on this interface

3. **UI-Game State Integration**
   - UI needs to reflect game state (health, ammo, score)
   - Team Members 1 and 2 should coordinate on this interface

4. **Audio-Game Events Integration**
   - Sound effects need to trigger on game events
   - Team Member 3 should implement a simple event system that others can use

## Testing Strategy

Given the tight 2-day timeline, testing should be focused and efficient:

1. **Rapid Testing**
   - Focus on manual testing of core gameplay
   - Test each feature immediately after implementation
   - Prioritize testing critical systems (collision, combat, scoring)

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test interactions between systems at the end of Day 1
   - Create simple test scenarios for common gameplay situations
   - Ensure all team members test the integrated build

3. **Final Playability Testing**
   - Conduct a group playtesting session at the end of Day 2
   - Focus on identifying critical bugs and gameplay issues
   - Make quick adjustments based on immediate feedback

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Review this implementation plan and task distribution as a team
2. Set up the expanded project structure and create empty files
3. Implement the base Entity system (highest priority)
4. Create the simple map generation foundation
5. Establish the basic collision detection system
6. Schedule an integration checkpoint at the end of Day 1

By following this focused implementation plan, the team can develop a functional zombie survival game within the 2-day timeframe while ensuring that all essential components work together seamlessly.
