# Deadlock - Potential Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements to the existing codebase and game features. Unlike the game_todo.md which focuses on new features, this document concentrates on enhancing what's already implemented.

## Code Architecture Improvements

### Refactoring Opportunities
- Implement a proper Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
- Move collision detection to a dedicated physics engine
- Separate rendering logic from game logic more consistently
- Create a more robust event system for game events
- Implement a proper scene graph for managing game objects

### Performance Optimizations
- Use spatial partitioning (quadtree/grid) for collision detection
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (bullets, effects)
- Optimize rendering with dirty rect tracking
- Implement level-of-detail system for distant objects
- Add frame skipping for low-end devices

### Technical Debt Reduction
- Standardize error handling across all modules
- Improve type hinting throughout the codebase
- Add more comprehensive unit tests
- Reduce code duplication in zombie and weapon classes
- Implement proper dependency injection

## Gameplay Improvements

### Combat Mechanics
- Fine-tune weapon balance (damage, fire rate, reload times)
- Improve hit detection precision
- Add critical hit system for more varied combat
- Implement more sophisticated zombie AI patterns
- Add visual feedback for successful hits

### Movement and Controls
- Smooth player movement with acceleration/deceleration
- Add controller support with customizable bindings
- Implement more responsive aiming system
- Add key rebinding options in settings
- Improve collision response for smoother navigation around obstacles

### User Interface
- Add more accessibility options (text size, color blindness support)
- Implement UI scaling for different resolutions
- Create more intuitive weapon selection interface
- Add visual tutorials for new players
- Improve feedback for player damage and healing

## Visual and Audio Enhancements

### Graphics Improvements
- Implement dynamic lighting system
- Add more varied animation frames for zombies and player
- Improve blood splatter and damage effects
- Add environmental details (grass, debris)
- Implement screen shake and other visual feedback

### Audio Refinements
- Add more varied sound effects for weapons
- Implement distance-based audio attenuation
- Add more ambient sound effects
- Improve audio mixing for better balance
- Add more music tracks for variety

## Quality of Life Improvements

### Game Settings
- Add more granular difficulty settings
- Implement custom game rules (zombie speed, spawn rate)
- Add options to customize UI elements
- Implement save/load for game settings
- Add performance presets for different hardware capabilities

### Player Experience
- Add more detailed statistics tracking
- Implement a pause menu with game options
- Add confirmation for game exit
- Implement auto-save feature
- Add tooltips for game mechanics

## Bug Fixes and Edge Cases

### Known Issues
- Fix zombie pathing when stuck in corners
- Address potential memory leaks in animation system
- Fix weapon switching during reload
- Resolve collision edge cases with fast-moving objects
- Fix audio overlapping issues with multiple sound effects

### Stability Improvements
- Add better error recovery mechanisms
- Implement crash reporting system
- Add automatic game state saving for crash recovery
- Improve handling of resource loading failures
- Add performance monitoring and automatic adjustments

## Development Process Improvements

### Build and Deployment
- Set up automated builds and testing
- Implement version control for game assets
- Create proper release packaging
- Add update mechanism for future versions
- Implement telemetry for gameplay statistics (opt-in)

### Documentation
- Improve code documentation with more examples
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add more detailed comments for complex algorithms
- Document game balance parameters
- Create contribution guidelines for open source collaboration
